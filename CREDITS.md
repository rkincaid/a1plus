EhBasic is the work of Lee Davison: http://retro.hansotten.nl/6502-sbc/lee-davison-web-site/

Apple1js by Will Scullin provided inspiration for packaging built-in programs as part of the system. 
My implemenation is different, but inspired
by this excellent on-line emulator. It was also very useful to compare output when debugging a1plus.
